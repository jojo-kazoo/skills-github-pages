title: Welcome to my blog!

This is me following the lovely, helpful Mona in the GitHub skills training on building pages. 
I have been building this page alongside trying to finish an assignment. Nothing like a bit of procrastination to drive you to learn a new skill, eh? 
Seems like I also need to **remind** myself how to *write* in *Markdown*! Something I used to do quite well, but skills do get rusty. 
**That's all for now - more anon!**
